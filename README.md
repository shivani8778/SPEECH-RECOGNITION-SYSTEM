##Speech recognition is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to understand and transcribe spoken language into text. This project presents a basic yet powerful speech-to-text system built using Wav2Vec2, a state-of-the-art pre-trained model from Facebook AI, implemented on Google Colab. The system converts a short audio file containing human speech into readable text using deep learning techniques.

The backbone of this project is Wav2Vec2, a transformer-based model designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Unlike traditional methods, Wav2Vec2 does not rely on handcrafted features or phoneme dictionaries. Instead, it learns contextual representations directly from raw audio waveforms, making it highly effective and accurate in noisy environments. We specifically use the facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h model, trained on 960 hours of English speech data from the LibriSpeech dataset.

The implementation is done on Google Colab, a cloud-based Python environment that requires no installation and provides free GPU support. The setup process involves installing three main Python libraries:

Transformers from Hugging Face: for loading pre-trained Wav2Vec2 models and tokenizers.

Torchaudio: to load and preprocess .wav audio files.

Soundfile (optional): for more flexible audio file reading and conversion.

The workflow begins by uploading a .wav file to the Colab environment. This file should be a short clip with clear spoken English. We then load the audio using torchaudio, resample it to 16kHz (as Wav2Vec2 requires this sample rate), and pass the waveform into the tokenizer and model. The model outputs probability distributions over characters, which are decoded using argmax and translated back into readable text.

One of the strengths of this system is its offline capability—after downloading the model and tokenizer, no further internet connection is required for transcription. This makes the system suitable for real-time applications or privacy-sensitive environments where sending audio to external APIs is not allowed.

The final output is printed on the screen: the transcribed text version of the spoken content in the audio file. For example, a file saying “Hello, welcome to the speech recognition system” will return that exact sentence as plain text.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how powerful and accessible speech recognition has become, thanks to pre-trained deep learning models and tools like Google Colab. With minimal code and setup, users can build a functional and accurate speech-to-text pipeline. This system can be extended for applications such as voice assistants, transcription services, accessibility tools, and more. Future enhancements may include live microphone input, support for multiple languages, or integrating a web interface using tools like Gradio or Flask.
